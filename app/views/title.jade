        h2 Who I Am.
        p I am a web programmer living in Music City. I am a transplanted Texan, a mother of 2 teenage boys, a U.S. Army Veteran.
        p I graduated from Texas A&M University- Corpus Christi with a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology and a minor in Chemistry. Afterwards, I briefly attended the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio pursuing a degree in medicine. There I found a love of the human anatomy and seeing the world through a scientific eye. Afterwards, I pursued a Master's Degree in Accounting, worked with several startups, all while raising two amazing boys at home. I entered the world of technology via the recruiting industry. When I started mingling and networking with software professionals, I knew I had found my flock. 
        p I am a "go" kind of person: go getter, go-to, go team, and go-go-gadget-whatever! I love organizing all the things, philosophical discussions, and binge watching tv with Wiggles(my coding dog). Outside of work I enjoy family, learning, and travel.

    h3 My approach? Simple and Functional. It is too easy for us to complicate our lives, why do so with our software?
