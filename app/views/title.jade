        h2 Who I Am.
        p I am a web programmer living in Music City. I am a transplanted Texan, a mother of 2 teenage boys, a U.S. Army Veteran.
        p I graduated from Texas A&M University- Corpus Christi with a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology with a minor in Chemistry. Afterwards, I briefly attended the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio pursuing a degree in medicine. There I found a love of the human anatomy and seeing the world through a scientific eye. Afterwards, I pursued a Master's Degree in Accounting, worked with several startups, all while raising two amazing boys at home. I entered the world of technology via the recruiting industry. When I started mingling and networking with software professionals, I knew I had found my flock. 
        p I am a "go" kind of person: go getter, go-to, go team, and go-go-gadget-whatever! I love organizing all the things, philosophical discussions, and . Outside of work I enjoy family, learning, and travel.

        p I just finished a 6 month software bootcamp in Nashville. I learned Frontend and Backend Development. 
        p Backend Development: Ruby, Rails, SQLite, Postgres
        p Frontend Development: HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, AngularJS. So far, in my short time as a programmer, I have found that I find particular enjoyment in javascript development.
        p In my previous experiences, I have found a satisfaction in discovering and implementing solutions. I am excited to now be doing just that with technology.
        p Approach: Simplicity and Functionality. It is too easy for us to complicate our lives, why do so with our software?
